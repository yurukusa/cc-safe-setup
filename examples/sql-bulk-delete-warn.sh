# sql-bulk-delete-warn: warn when a SQL DELETE/UPDATE statement is about to
# run via psql / mysql / sqlite3 / sqlcmd without a row-count safeguard.
#
# Motivated by Issue #56738 (claude-code, 2026-05-06): a regex with capture
# groups in regexp_match returned NULL for nearly every row, and the
# subsequent `DELETE FROM table WHERE _clean_title IS NULL` wiped 24,472 of
# 24,475 rows. autovacuum cleaned dead tuples within ~5 minutes, blocking
# pg_dirtyread recovery. 3 days of scraping work permanently lost.
#
# Detected high-risk patterns:
#   1. DELETE / UPDATE with no WHERE clause (full-table touch)
#   2. DELETE WHERE col IS NULL (Issue #56738 pattern: NULL arises from a
#      computed column populated by a prior UPDATE that may have failed)
#   3. DELETE / UPDATE without a LIMIT in MySQL contexts
#
# Strict mode: set CC_SQL_BULK_DELETE_BLOCK=1 to exit 2 instead of warning.
