# cc-safe-setup

One command to add safety hooks to [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code). It installs a set of `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `Stop`, and `SubagentStop` hooks that stop destructive or irreversible operations *before* they run, and that surface silent failures.

```sh
npx cc-safe-setup
```

The command is interactive: it shows what each hook does and lets you choose which to install into your `~/.claude/settings.json` (or a project-local `.claude/settings.json`). Nothing is installed without your confirmation. MIT licensed.

## The npm release is behind this repository

`npx cc-safe-setup` currently installs **29.8.0**, published 2026-04-20. This repository is at **30.0.4**. Publishing is blocked on renewing an npm credential, so npm keeps serving 29.8.0 until that is done.

The gap is not cosmetic. Fed the same JSON on stdin, the guards shipped in 29.8.0 allow three operations that 30.0.4 refuses:

| Command seen by the hook | 29.8.0 | 30.0.4 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rm -rf $HOME/x` — home directory reached through a shell variable | allowed | blocked |
| `foo & git reset --hard` — a single `&` used as the separator | allowed | blocked |
| `true && git add .env` — a secret staged through a chained command | allowed | blocked |

29.8.0 ships 698 example hooks against this repository's 908 — among the 210 missing is `agents-md-sync-checker`. It also predates a fix for example hooks that were registered under a matcher other than the one they declare, which let them install without ever firing.

To install the current code directly from this repository:

```sh
npx github:yurukusa/cc-safe-setup
```

That resolves to the default branch. To pin an exact revision, append a commit SHA — `npx github:yurukusa/cc-safe-setup#<sha>`. Pin by SHA rather than by tag: the tag names here come from an older numbering that no longer tracks `package.json`.

## Why this exists

Claude Code can run shell commands, edit files, and call tools on your behalf. Most of the time that is fine. But a single command — `rm -rf`, a force-push, `terraform destroy`, `php artisan migrate:fresh`, a `git checkout --orphan` followed by `git rm -rf .` — can destroy work in a way that is not recoverable, and it can happen without an error or a warning.

Claude Code's built-in safety checks match shell-level danger patterns. Many destructive operations do not look like those patterns: a framework verb, a tool-call, or a config file poisoned from outside the tool boundary all slip past. These hooks add a second layer that inspects the operation at the tool boundary and refuses the dangerous ones, while letting normal work through.

## What gets installed

Hooks are small, dependency-free shell scripts. Each is one file, does one thing, and exits with code `2` to block or `0` to allow. They fall into a few groups:

- **Destructive-operation guards** — refuse `rm -rf` on protected paths, force-push, `git reset --hard`, whole-tree `git rm`, framework database resets (`migrate:fresh`, `db:reset`, `prisma migrate reset`), cloud teardown verbs (`terraform destroy`, `aws … terminate`, `kubectl delete namespace`), and move-then-delete sequences.
- **Data-loss prevention** — a recycle bin for deleted files, backups before refactors, detection of NUL-corrupted writes, and guards for the `mv`/glob/`rm` and worktree failure modes.
- **Cost and quota** — token-spike early warnings, per-session budget limits, subagent fan-out limits, and warnings when usage is silently routed to API billing.
- **Silent-failure surfacing** — detectors for fabricated tool results, unverified "done" claims, forged system-reminder markup from sub-agents, and config poisoned from outside the tool boundary (read-only audits that warn, never edit).
- **Session and config protection** — backups of `settings.json`, drift detection, and recovery helpers.
- **Code-quality checks** (opt-in) — syntax checks, test-before-commit, and language-specific linters that run after edits.

Run `npx cc-safe-setup --list` to see every available hook with its description.

## How it works

Claude Code calls a hook before (or after) a tool runs and passes it JSON on stdin describing the tool call. The hook reads the command, decides, and communicates through its exit code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
CMD=$(cat | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')
case "$CMD" in
  *"migrate:fresh"*|*"db:wipe"*)
    echo "Blocked: destructive database reset. Use an incremental migration." >&2
    exit 2 ;;   # exit 2 = block the tool call
esac
exit 0          # exit 0 = allow
```

Because the check happens at the tool boundary, it fires regardless of how the command was constructed, and it works in auto-accept mode where a human is not reviewing each step.

## Writing your own hook

A hook is any executable that reads the tool-call JSON on stdin and returns `0` (allow) or `2` (block, with a message on stderr). Drop it in your hooks directory and reference it from `settings.json` under the matching trigger (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `PermissionRequest`) with a `matcher` for the tool it should watch. See `examples/` for working scripts to copy.

## Safety audit and CI

`npx cc-safe-setup --audit` scans your current `settings.json` and reports which classes of danger are and are not guarded. You can run the same audit in CI to keep a project's safety posture from regressing:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/safety.yml
- run: npx cc-safe-setup --audit --ci
```

## Windows

The hooks run under WSL2 and Git Bash. A few guards are Windows-specific (path handling, CJK-write corruption, the `ext4.vhdx` growth case). See `docs/windows.md`.

## Troubleshooting

If a hook does not fire, check that it is executable, that its path in `settings.json` is correct, and that the `matcher` names the right tool. `npx cc-safe-setup --doctor` checks these and reports what is misconfigured.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Each hook should be a single dependency-free script with a test. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the layout and the test harness.
